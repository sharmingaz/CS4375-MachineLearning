# CS4375-MachineLearning
This repository is for my Machine Learning class where I will be uploading my class work

## Overview of ML
This is the first assignment for my Machine Learning class and can be viewed  [here](https://github.com/sharmingaz/CS4375-MachineLearning/blob/main/Overview%20of%20ML.pdf)

## Data Exploration
I explored different statistical measures using C++ programming and compared it to built in R functions. My code can be viewed  [here](https://github.com/sharmingaz/CS4375-MachineLearning/blob/main/dataExploration.cpp) and to read my pdf click  [here](https://github.com/sharmingaz/CS4375-MachineLearning/blob/main/data_exploration.pdf) 

## Linear Models
I found two unique data sets to explore linear models using [regression](https://github.com/sharmingaz/CS4375-MachineLearning/blob/main/Regression.pdf) and [classification](https://github.com/sharmingaz/CS4375-MachineLearning/blob/main/Classification.pdf) in R.

## Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch
I used a titanic data set to find the logistic regression of survived based on other predictors using C++ for [program 1](https://github.com/sharmingaz/CS4375-MachineLearning/blob/main/program1_C%2B%2B_Scratch.cpp) and for [program 2](https://github.com/sharmingaz/CS4375-MachineLearning/blob/main/program2_C%2B%2B_Scratch.cpp) I used Naive Bayes.
